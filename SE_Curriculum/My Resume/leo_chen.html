            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I have over 21 years of practical experience in online entertainment and email marketing services. In 2000, I founded an entertainment portal and website marketing business, wherein these businesses were generating over 250,000 unique visitors combined daily.
I was able to generate targeted web traffic through the use of email co-registration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In connection with the business, and to increase efficiency, I set up and installed multiple dedicated servers across multiple racks hosted at data centers across New York and New Jersey. I installed and configured routers, switches and firewalls on Cisco and Dell equipment as well as multiple operating systems like Windows 2003, Windows 2008 and CentOS 4-7.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003, I pivoted from an entertainment company to become a dedicated Email Service Provider and consultant. The clients who required the services ran similar entertainment websites and needed an email service provider who could assist them in sending their targeted emails. Throughout the years, I assisted clients in increasing email deliverability by following email best practices and using enterprise email software programs such as Port25's Power MTA and Lyris/Aurea ListManager. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been consulting and running all the hardware and software, as well as dealing with software vendors and supporting clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                My most valuable knowledge has been through years of practical real world experiences. I am resourceful and a hard worker. I believe that there is nothing a person cannot do with all the online resources currently available. If you need someone who is diligent, hardworking and has many useful and practical skillsets, I am your person.
